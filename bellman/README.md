# bellman "Community edition"
 
Originally developed for ZCash, it has diverged now and focuses solely on the [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) proof system. Uses our "community edition" pairing for Ethereum's BN256 curve. 

## Features

Allows one to design PLONK circuits with custom gates and lookup tables with junction with [franklin-crypto](https://github.com/matter-labs/franklin-crypto) gadget library. At the moment the lookup argument implies using the lookup over the first three state columns (usually refered as A/B/C) and allows to have simultaneously a gate and a lookup applied on the same row of the trace.
